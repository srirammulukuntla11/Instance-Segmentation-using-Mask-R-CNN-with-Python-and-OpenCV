# Instance-Segmentation-using-Mask-R-CNN-with-Python-and-OpenCV
This project detects and segments objects in images using Mask R-CNN with Python and OpenCV. It draws bounding boxes with labels, overlays colored masks, and counts detected objects. Results are shown with clear visualizations and a console summary for better analysis of object instances.
